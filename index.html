    STEM Ensemble is a diverse and inclusive group of makers, artists and educators who work together to deliver workshops, exhibits and installations for the general public in the areas of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). We stage workshops in a variety of settings, including libraries, schools and other venues. Our workshops typically focus on robotics, electronics and/or programming. We regularly exhibit work at festivals and other events - most of our installations involve some kind of interactive experience that teaches visitors something scientific or technical.
